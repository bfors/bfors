### Welcome

I'm currently working on learning rust and low level data management through implementing simple storage engines.

<summary>Log-structured key-value store</summary>
https://github.com/bfors/lskv/

Based on bitcask, designed for high throughput and crash resilience.

All commands are written to a log file in the order they are received, and an in-memory index maps keys to the corresponding file locations where the values are found. Log files are append only, and periodically get compacted to drop stale data.
